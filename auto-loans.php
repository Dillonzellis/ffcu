	<p>Family First Credit Union offers low interest rates for cars with a variety of convenient terms on both new and used vehicles.  Before you buy a car, please consult a loan officer at the credit union for guidance.  We can help you save hundreds of dollars by providing you with the important information you need to know.  We will provide you with the lowest rates, financing comparisons, dealer invoices, cost of extra car options, NADA retail and trade-in values, and the option of using Car Buying Service.  You can reduce your car loan rate by .50% by pledging $2,000.00 in your Share Savings Account.</p>
	<p>Ideally, the first step in buying a car is to pre-qualify so you can go shopping with your "loan in hand".  If you have already purchased a new or used car, it is not too late to take advantage of your credit union loan service.  We can match or possibly offer a lower interest rate in refinancing your car which in turn will save you money.</p>
	<p>With your car loan, you can purchase the following products for added protection for much less than what the dealerships charge for them:</p>

              <div class="acc_content"> 
				  <p>Most people believe that if their vehicle is totaled or stolen, their primary insurance will pay off their loan/lease balance. Well, think again!</p>
				  <p>If your vehicle is totaled or stolen, your primary insurance carrier will usually pay only the actual cash value (current market value) of your vehicle less your deductible.  This amount could be substantially lower than your loan/lease balance.</p>

					<p>The final result is a financial GAP where you must pay the difference between your loan/lease balance and your insurance settlement, which could mean thousands of dollars out of your pocket.</p>

					<p>GAP coverage helps eliminate the out-of-pocket expense you would incur to pay off your loan/lease should your vehicle be stolen or totaled.</p>

Mechanical breakdowns can be very expensive to repair.

We have partnered with Vision Warranty Corporation to offer a service contract that best fits your needs.  This service contract comes with many benefits such as:</p>
